Introduction
------------

Loom is a modern build tool for Java based projects.
It focuses on simplicity, conventions, ease of use and performance.
It uses a very simple, declarative configuration (YAML) and
convention over configuration to reduce the configuration to a bare minimum.


Requirements
------------

Loom requires **JDK 9** to build and run but it can build projects
**targeting Java 6-9** through JDKs cross-compile functionality.

Java 9 can be downloaded from `http://jdk.java.net/9/ <http://jdk.java.net/9/>`_.
Loom is excessively tested against build ``jdk-9+181``.
